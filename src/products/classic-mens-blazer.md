This classic men's blazer combines timeless style with modern comfort. The regular fit provides a clean silhouette without restricting movement, while the premium cotton blend offers breathability with just the right amount of stretch.

Perfect for formal occasions, business meetings, or elevating your casual attire, this versatile blazer pairs well with chinos, dress pants, or even dark jeans. The notched lapel and two-button closure create a traditional look that never goes out of style.

Practical details include three interior pockets for secure storage of essentials and four exterior pockets. Available in navy, black, and gray to complement any wardrobe.

For best results, dry clean only to maintain the blazer's shape and appearance.
